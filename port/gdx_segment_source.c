/* Single byte-source shim. See gdx_segment_source.h.
 *
 * Resolves an absolute ROM read archive-first via the generated segment_blob
 * table (port/gen/AssetBindings.c), falling back to the raw ROM image
 * (gdx_rom_buffer). Blob payloads are loaded once per family and cached for the
 * process lifetime (ROM data is read-only) -- there is NO allocation on the
 * per-frame read path, only on the first load of each family.
 *
 * Thread safety: the graphics thread, the game thread, and the dedicated audio
 * std::thread (via the osEPiStartDma DMA sink) all call the shim.
 * First-load of a family (the only mutating operation) is serialized under one
 * lock, mirroring n64_sched.c's gdx_mq_lock (SRWLOCK on Windows, pthread_mutex
 * elsewhere). Once a family's payload pointer is published it is immutable, so
 * the payload memcpy is done AFTER releasing the lock.
